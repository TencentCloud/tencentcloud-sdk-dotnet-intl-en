            2. [Face search](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/44994?from_cn_redirect=1): this is to ensure the quality of the input image to quickly find the corresponding person.
            
            3. [Face verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/44983?from_cn_redirect=1): this is to ensure the quality of the face information to avoid cases where the verification incorrectly fails.

            This API is used to detect the position, attributes, and quality information of a face in the given image. The position information includes (x, y, w, h); the face attributes include gender, age, expression, beauty, glass, hair, mask, and pose (pitch, roll, yaw); and the face quality information includes the overall quality score, sharpness, brightness, and completeness.

            This API is used to detect the liveness of faces in images uploaded by users and determine whether these images are photographed.
            
            Compared with normal Image-based Liveness Detection services, this API enhances the defense capability against attacks from HD screens, printed photos, and 3D masks, as well as improves attack blocking four to five times the competing products, while maintaining high accuracy.

            This API is used to judge whether a person in an image corresponds to a given `PersonId`. For more information on `PersonId`, please see [Group Management APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/867/45015?from_cn_redirect=1).
            This API fuses the features of all face images of a person; for example, if a person has 4 face images, it will fuse the features of the 4 face images and generate the summarized facial features of the person to make the person verification (i.e., judging whether the face image to be recognized is of a specified person) more accurate.
            
             The face verification APIs judge whether a person is someone specified whose information is stored in a group, and the "someone" may have multiple face images. By contrast, the face comparison APIs judge the similarity between two faces.
            
            
            >     
            - Please use the signature algorithm v3 to calculate the signature in the common parameters, that is, set the `SignatureMethod` parameter to `TC3-HMAC-SHA256`.
            - This feature is available only to groups whose algorithm model version (`FaceModelVersion`) is 3.0.

            The download speed and stability of non-Tencent Cloud URLs may be low.
            If there are multiple faces in the image, only the face with the largest size will be selected.
            PNG, JPG, JPEG, and BMP images are supported, while GIF images are not.

        <member name="P:TencentCloud.Iai.V20200303.Models.VerifyPersonRequest.NeedRotateDetection">
            <summary>
            Whether to enable the support for rotated image recognition. 0: no; 1: yes. Default value: 0. When the face in the image is rotated and the image has no EXIF information, if this parameter is not enabled, the face in the image cannot be correctly detected and recognized. If you are sure that the input image contains EXIF information or the face in the image will not be rotated, do not enable this parameter, as the overall time consumption may increase by hundreds of milliseconds after it is enabled.
